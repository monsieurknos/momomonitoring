# Empirical Validations
## Against Actuarial Approach
Compute expected mortality at same level (Micha: approach?) with a reasonable actuarial model and compare against MoMo method
## Against Age Pymarid cross-country
Plot excess mortality bounds against age pyramid for several countries (see [R-Code](mortan.R))
## Against Age Pyramid cross country with actuarial approach
Plot excess mortality bounds against age pyramid for several countries for both approaches (Actuarial Approach and MoMo-Approach)
